Code to answer Python IBM Data Science Capstone 
This capstone focuses on analyzing the historical data of the claims received in the NYC311 service, particularly those related to housing infrastructure problems, in order to:

Q1: Identifying main problems (Heat/Hot Water)

Q2: Clustering geographic areas with the greatest number of Heat/Hot Water complaints (Bronx south and Manhattan North)

Q3: Evaluating if there is a relationship between the structural characteristics of the dwellings and the number of complaints (mainly year of built)

Q4: Modeling and forecasting possible future complaints regarding heating that will be received by NYC311 service (Using logit and SVM with more than .999 accuracity)
